            <p>No merging of these data with other data sources is carried out.</p>
            <p>The collection of these data is based on Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website &ndash; for this purpose the server log files must be collected.</p>
            <h3>Request by E-Mail, Telephone or Telefax</h3>

            <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or to the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests directed to us (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent isrevocable.</p>
            <p>The data sent to us by you in contact requests remain with us until you request deletion, withdraw your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage ceases (e.g. after the completion of the processing of your request). Mandatory legal regulations &ndash; in particular legal retention periods &ndash; remain unaffected.</p>
